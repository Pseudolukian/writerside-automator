# Writerside automator

This repository contains Git hooks, GitHub workflows, and other automation scripts for deploying Writerside documentation easily and quickly.

Currently, you can find the following automation:

1. A set of Git hooks for two-way tag synchronization for multi-version documentation deployment;
2. GitHub workflows for:
   * Previewing deployed documentation on GitHub Pages;
   * Deploying documentation to S3-compatible storage (using `boto3`).
